        1. You can upload an <b>excel</b> file or <b>csv</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        2. Set the excel sheet from where to export the data. The default is the first sheet.
    </p>

    <p>
        3. Go to the Advanced Excel Options to set the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Set the Row to start reading data from. If first row (Row 1) has column names, then set to row 2 to skip row
            1 with the column names
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the column range to read. By default this has been set from Column A to Column J (10 columns). Usually
            this will work unless you have many columns you are exporting in which case you can increase the range from
            A to J to A to Z
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
